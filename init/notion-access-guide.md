# Quick Guide: Grant Notion Access to Fetch All Knowledge

## Why This Is Needed

Notion's API requires **explicit sharing** of pages/databases with integrations. Even with your API key, content can't be read unless shared.

## Fastest Method: Share Your Workspace Root

### Option 1: Share a Parent/Root Page (2 minutes)

1. **In Notion**, find the main page/folder that contains all your knowledge
2. **Click the ••• menu** (top-right of the page)
3. **Click "Add connections"**
4. **Select "cc"** (your integration)
5. **Choose access level**: "Full access" or "Can edit"

### Option 2: Share Multiple Pages at Once

1. Go to your main knowledge database or page
2. Open the page
3. Follow steps 2-5 above

### Option 3: Share Individual Important Pages

Repeat the above for each key page:
- Documentation pages
- Knowledge base pages
- Process/workflow pages
- Strategy documents

## Verify Access

After sharing, you'll see "cc" listed under connections on the page.

## Then I Can:

Once you share the pages, I'll immediately:

1. **Fetch ALL content** from your Notion workspace
2. **Categorize by agent domain:**
   - Strategy → chief-strategist
   - Campaigns → campaign-planner
   - Content → copywriting-lead, design-specialist
   - Technical → integration-engineer
   - Data → data-analyst
   - Compliance → compliance-officer
   - Deliverability → deliverability-expert
   - etc.

3. **Update each agent's skills.md and knowledge.md** with your internal knowledge
4. **Create specialized skills** based on your specific processes

## One-Time Setup

This is a one-time setup. Once the pages are shared, I can read everything and keep your agents synchronized with your knowledge base.

**Please share at least your main knowledge pages with the "cc" integration, then tell me when ready and I'll fetch everything and update your agents.**
